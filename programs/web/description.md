The Web Developer program introduces the core concepts and practical techniques required to pursue a career in web site development. Students will learn how to implement Webpages using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Responsive Web Design and AngularJS. The program includes optional courses in Perl, PHP, ASP.NET or Python.

Courses can be taken either face-to-face in the classroom or via remote attendance. Remote attendance connects students to a live classroom presentation that includes a mix of in-person and remote students. You decide which courses to attend in person or remotely. All programming courses include at least 50% of time performing comprehensive hands on exercises facilitated by expert instructors. This boosts retention and confidence as well as assuring competency with the new skills being acquired.

Our self-directed scheduling allows you the flexibility you require to complete your training in the time frame you need.
