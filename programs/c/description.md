The C/C++ Programmer bootcamp includes coverage of programming in both the C and C++ languages.

Our unique approach combines on-demand streaming with personal facilitation and comprehensive hands-on exercises to assure successful training and competence in the IT workplace. Our support staff provides personal setup assistance, guidance and lab equipment setup for each student. An instructor is assigned to each student to assist in completing lab exercises and to help with any questions about the course content. Our classes are designed to be 50% lecture and 50% hands on exercises. Lab exercises are performed via direct high-speed access to a dedicated lab machine, providing responsive interaction and anywhere/anytime accessibility by the lab facilitator as well as the student.

In the C Programming course, students are introduced to all major language elements including fundamental data types, flow control, and standard function libraries. The C++ course introduces core object oriented programming concepts including inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. C++ syntax and style are taught in the context of using object-oriented methods to achieve reusability, adaptability and reliability. Students can utilize Microsoft Visual Studio to complete hands-on labs or a UNIX-based environment if desired.
