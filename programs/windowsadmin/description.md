The Windows System Administrator program provides the knowledge and skills required to competently install, configure, and maintain client and server operating systems and support remote users as well as install and configure Exchange Server 2013.

Courses can be taken either face-to-face in the classroom or via remote attendance. Remote attendance connects students to a live classroom presentation that includes a mix of in-person and remote students. You decide which courses to attend in person or remotely. All programming courses include at least 50% of time performing comprehensive hands on exercises facilitated by expert instructors. This boosts retention and confidence as well as assuring competency with the new skills being acquired.

Our self-directed scheduling allows you the flexibility you require to complete your training in the time frame you need.
